          Hello everyone, ðŸ‘‹. Welcome to my personal site. I'm, as stated above,
          a Front End Developer. I don't know what to write here. I'm not great
          at talking about myself. So, here's me. I'm a 33 year old developer. I
          want success in my life and I'm making strides towards that. I work
          incredibly hard and try to learn as much as I can.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to be the best me I can be. I want to be an amazing developer
          that people recognize for making amazing content and products that
          people enjoy using.
        </p>
        <p></p>
