          . Welcome to my personal site. I'm, as stated above, a Front End
          Developer. I don't know what to write here. I'm not great at talking
          about myself. So, here's me. I'm a 33 year old developer. I want
          success in my life and I'm making strides towards that. I work
          incredibly hard and try to learn as much as I can.
          <br />
