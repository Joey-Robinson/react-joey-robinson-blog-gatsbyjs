          . Welcome to my personal site. I'm, as stated above, a Front End
          Developer. I don't know what to write here. I'm not great at talking
          about myself. So, here's me. I'm a 33 year old developer. I want
          success in my life and I'm making strides towards that. I work
          incredibly hard and try to learn as much as I can.
          <br />

          Here's a picture of my cute dog:

            I don't have much else to say. I love Hamilton, The Musical. I like
            a lot of heavy rock. I'm self-conscious but like to put on a front.
            I often take criticism very personal and try to not show it. I've
            overcome many obstacles to be where I am now, but I'm nowhere near
            where I want to be. Until I get there, I'll continue to keep moving
            forward towards my own personal goals.
          </p>

            I like thought provoking questions and discussions. Some people will
            say I'm overly optimistic but I see that as a strength. I can come
            off as cold or rude at times, but that's not anyones fault but my
            own.
